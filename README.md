In this repository, I have implemented Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression from scratch using Python. The implementation utilizes the California Housing Dataset, a popular dataset in machine learning, to demonstrate the functionality and performance of the regression models.
The implementation of Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression is done from scratch using Python and NumPy. We leverage OLS(Ordinary Least Square) method to update the model parameters and minimize the mean squared error loss function.
